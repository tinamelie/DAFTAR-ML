DAFTAR-ML OUTPUT FILES EXPLANATION
================================================================================

This document explains the various files and visualizations generated by DAFTAR-ML.

1. OVERVIEW OF OUTPUT ORGANIZATION
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
DAFTAR-ML organizes results in a structured way:
- Main output directory: Contains global visualizations and summary files
- fold_X/ directories: Contain fold-specific results
- feature_importance/ directory: Contains feature importance visualizations and data files
- optuna_plots/ directories: Contain hyperparameter optimization visualizations

2. SAMPLE-LEVEL VS. FOLD-LEVEL CALCULATIONS
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
DAFTAR-ML uses two complementary methods for analyzing feature importance:

Sample-level (all samples combined):
- Calculated using all individual samples across all folds
- Shows overall feature impact across the full dataset
- May be more influenced by outliers
- Identified by '_sample' suffix in filenames

Fold-level (fold averages combined):
- First calculates averages within each fold, then averages across folds
- Shows features that are consistently important across different data splits
- More robust to random variation
- Identified by '_fold' suffix in filenames

3. SHAP ANALYSIS VISUALIZATIONS
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SHAP Beeswarm Plots:
- shap_beeswarm_sample.png: Sample-level SHAP values distribution
- shap_beeswarm_fold.png: Fold-level SHAP values distribution
Each dot represents a sample or fold average, with color indicating the feature value (red=high, blue=low).
Features are ordered by their SHAP impact. Points to the right have positive impact, left have negative impact.

SHAP Bar Plots:
- shap_bar_sample.png: Top features by sample-level impact
- shap_bar_fold.png: Top features by fold-level impact (includes cross-validation error bars)
These plots show the average SHAP value impact for the most important features.
Positive values (red) increase predictions, negative values (blue) decrease predictions.

SHAP Correlation Plots (Regression Only):
- shap_corr_bar_sample.png: Correlation between SHAP values and target at sample level
- shap_corr_bar_fold.png: Correlation between SHAP values and target at fold level
- shap_corr_sample.csv: Raw correlation data at sample level
- shap_corr_fold.csv: Raw correlation data at fold level
These plots show how consistently feature SHAP values align with the target variable.
Positive correlation (red) means the feature's SHAP values tend to match the target's direction.
Negative correlation (blue) means the feature's SHAP values tend to oppose the target's direction.

4. FEATURE IMPORTANCE VISUALIZATIONS
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Feature Importance Bar Plots:
- feature_importance/feature_importance_bar_sample.png: Sample-level importance
- feature_importance/feature_importance_bar_fold.png: Fold-level importance
These plots show traditional feature importance values from the model with error bars.
Unlike SHAP values, these don't indicate direction (positive/negative), only magnitude of importance.
Error bars show standard deviation of importance across folds.

5. PREDICTION VISUALIZATIONS
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

For Classification:
- confusion_matrix_global.png: Overall confusion matrix for all folds combined
- fold_X/confusion_matrix_fold_X.png: Confusion matrix for specific fold

For Regression:
- density_actual_vs_pred_global.png: Distribution of actual vs. predicted values (all folds)
- fold_X/density_plot_fold_X.png: Density plot for specific fold
Includes performance metrics in the right margin.

6. HYPERPARAMETER OPTIMIZATION VISUALIZATIONS
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Located in fold_X/optuna_plots/ directories:
- optuna_history_foldX.html: Shows how the objective value improved over trials
- optuna_parallel_foldX.html: Shows relationship between hyperparameters and performance
- optuna_slice_foldX.html: Shows effect of each hyperparameter on performance
- fold_X/hyperparameter_tuning_summary_foldX.txt: Text summary of hyperparameter optimization
